# how to code in c++
hello people i am new to github ummmmm yeah.

just look at this source code, what you will wanna do is create a main.cpp file.

just follow what this code says

but before you must learn about comments
//this is a 1-lined comment

/*this
is
a
multi
lined
comment
*/

now take a look
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
std::cout << "hello world, this is how to output text" << std::endl;
int num; /* this is how to make an integer variable */
cin >> num; /* this is how to make user inputs */
}
// thx for seeing this
```
